[quote] [h1] Info [/h1] 
- This is a standalone version of the estate system from my shattered mod tweaked for the Anbennar setting.

- Reworked UI
- New interactions
- Ability to Sell/Seize land from specific estates
- Crownland reworked and now is a choice of where you want to be on the 0%-100% scale.
