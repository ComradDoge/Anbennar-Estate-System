- This is a standalone version of the estate system from my vanilla Shattered mod for the Anbennar setting.

- Reworked UI
- New interactions
- Ability to Sell/Seize land from specific estates
- Crownland reworked and now is a choice of where you want to be on the 0%-100% scale.

- Anyone is free to use this mod as they see fit, just add the credits.
- Suggestions for Crownland to make it more appropriate for Anbennar are always welcome

[h1] BitBucket [/h1]

BitBucket version does work, however, you will see graphical estate icon issues due to there being more on that branch. I will prioritize steam version of mod but will try to have bitbucket compatible as best as I can.
